#Glimpses at others
#Seems too early, impressions at most

    "Ethan introduces himself on the airship, likely looking out the window and considering his past."
   
    e "I reflect about the Grimm attack that was barely averted but would have caused dozens if not hundreds of deaths to be my fault if it had taken place."
   
    "A CG will likely be place here, as well as greater expansion on the RWBY universe."
    "However, very soon, he is interrupted by a slap on the back by a more cheerful figure."
   
    m "I'm Mason. I comment on Ethan's soberness and act as his foil, telling him to cheer up and celebrate his acceptance into Beacon."
    
    e "I make a coy comment about how Mason isn't 'actually' qualified to be a Hunter, but end up smiling due to his positivity."

    m "I retort with a similar harmless insult."
    
    e "As we continue speaking, I touch lightly on how I got to know Mason, our first meeting in particular."
    e "The memory is heartwarming but not discussed in-depth."
    
    "Mason and Ethan look around at the other future hunters present."
    
    m "I take a good long look at Yang, who I point out to Ethan and refer to as 'hotpants chick'."
    
    e "I point out that Mason is being a creep."
    
    m "I grumble that Ethan has no sex drive and will never get a girlfriend in a fashion ironic given the nature of the game."
    
    e "I admit that it is true I've never had a girlfriend, but this is because of my reserved nature rather than personal capability to do so."
    e "Also, Mason is a jackass for breaking the fourth wall."
    
    "Faunus civil rights protest TV broadcast here. The situation presented makes both young men very uncomfortable and stop talking."
    "Soon, however, it is interrupted by Gynda Goodwitch's announcement."
    
    m "After the announcement ends, I imitate Glynda's serious tone in a mocking fashion. Insert Spider-Man reference here."
   
    e "I make a cynical but joking comment about the nature of Beacon, before informing Mason of the incredible view."
    
    "A CG sky view of Beacon appears, staying on the screen for the next few comments."
    
    m "I wonder out loud about how the school will actually be, and confess to Ethan that I'm personally nervous."
    m "This helps display my honest but blunt nature."
    
    e "I nod, but don't respond verbally, internalizing my fears and signalling that confronting my hesitant nature is part of my future character development."
